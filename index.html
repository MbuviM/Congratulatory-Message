              The sacrifices you've made to get to this point. The tears you've shed when you thought you couldn't go on.
              But you did it. You persevered. You overcame. And now, you're here. You've made it. And I couldn't be more proud of you.
              Congratulations on your graduation. You deserve all the success and happiness in the world. I love you.
