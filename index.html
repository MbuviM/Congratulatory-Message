              mornings to study for exams. The sacrifices you've made to get to this point. The tears you've shed when
              you thought you couldn't go on. But you did it. You persevered. You overcame. And now, you're here.
              You've made it. And I couldn't be more proud of you. Congratulations on your graduation. You deserve all
              the success and happiness in the world. I love you.
